# SwiftUIInUIKit

very simple sample of SwiftUI in UIKit. This sample project shows how to show SwiftUI view from UIKit.


- Use UIHostingViewController
- Note that UIHostingViewController.viewDidLoad() will not be called, so you need to implement operations to update view appearance or other things.
